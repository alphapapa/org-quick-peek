This looks really nice! A few things I discovered:

1. If the peek contains a link and I click on it with the left mouse
button, the message "No link found" is displayed.

2. If a headline in the agenda contains a link to another headline and
point is somewhere on that headline and I call org-quick-peek-link I
get "Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil)".

3. If point is on a link to another headline in a normal org buffer
and I call org-quick-peek-link I get "Lisp error: (void-variable
path)". This is fixed applying this patch:
