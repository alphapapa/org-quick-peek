[[https://melpa.org/#/helm-navi][file:https://melpa.org/packages/org-quick-peek-badge.svg]]

This package lets you quickly "peek" at the contents of Org nodes that are off-screen, using the [[https://github.com/cpitclaudel/quick-peek/][quick-peek]] package by [[https://github.com/cpitclaudel/quick-peek/][Clément Pit-Claudel]].

** Installation

Install the package from MELPA and you're all set!

If you want to install it manually, put =org-quick-peek.el= in your =load-path=, then add this to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'org-quick-peek)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Run =org-quick-peek-mode= to activate these commands:

+ =org-quick-peek-link= shows the contents of a linked node when the point is on an Org link that links to another Org heading.
+ =org-quick-peek-agenda-current-item=, bound to =M-p= by default, shows the contents of the currently selected item in the Agenda.
+ =org-quick-peek-agenda-all= shows the contents of every item in the Agenda.  This looks nicer than =org-agenda-entry-text-mode=, but it may be much slower in large Agenda buffers.

** Tips

You can customize key bindings and more in the =org-quick-peek= customization group.

** Contributions

Yes, please.
